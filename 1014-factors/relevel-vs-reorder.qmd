Relevel--reorder manually
```{r}
PlantGrowth |> 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = fct_relevel(group, c("trt1", "trt2", "ctrl")),
                       y = weight)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

Reorder--reorder based on weight in ascending order
```{r}
PlantGrowth |> 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = fct_reorder(group, weight, .fun = "mean"),
                       y = weight)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

Reorder--reorder based on weight in descending order
```{r}
PlantGrowth |> 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = fct_reorder(group, weight, .fun = "mean", .desc = TRUE),
                       y = weight)) +
  geom_boxplot()
